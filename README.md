# Home Certificate Authority Project

## Purpose

This repository contains the configuration materials used to generate a certificate hierarchy for use in my home
and home lab networks.

## Prerequisites

- [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
- openssl (3.0+)

Prerequisites are automatically handled by `go-task.` This includes version checks.

## Quickstart

First, copy `config.conf.sample` to `config.conf` and populate values therein.

Next, generate a root CA:

`task genca`

Next, assuming for a moment you need a certificate for `coolserver.vmnet.arpa`,  generate a certificate for
it (pay special attention to the `--`):

`task gencert -- coolserver.vmnet.arpa`

Finally, when you're done and/or need to setup a new hierarchy, you can clean up and start over:

`task obliterate`

(I'm using obliterate instead of clean to signal that this is a destructive operation)

## Installing Certificate Authority to your system

Certificates generated by this repository must have the root CA materials (generated through the `genca` 
task) installed to the system OR configured into the authorizing application (such as `nginx`) before 
certificates signed by it can be authenticated and authorized.

Instructions vary greatly between operating systems and applications.
